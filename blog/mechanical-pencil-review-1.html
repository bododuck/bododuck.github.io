    <h1>Mechanical Pencil Review</h1>
    <a class="date">15 July 2024</a>
    <div class="text">
      <pre>
        This is my review of 5 Mechanical Pencils: GraphGear 500, Kuru Toga Standard Version, Kuru Toga KS, Pentel Smash, and the Staedtler 925 25. This is my personal review on these pencils. 
      </pre>

        GraphGear 500
      </a>
      <pre>
        The GraphGear 500 is a relatively cheap pencil with a metal grip, tip and clip. The rest of the pencil is plastic. The clip is relatively easy to remove but is quite hard to put back. 

This pencil's grip is round while the barrel is hexagonal, making it easy to rotate. The grip is has metal knurling and is comfortable to use. Its drafting tip makes it easy to use a ruler, but prevents it from being pocket safe and requires a pencil case to prevent the tip from breaking. Also, as it is a cheaper pencil, it's barrel shakes while using and can be felt while writing. 

For the price of the pencil, it is a great pencil and I would recommend it to people wanting a pencil which will be used with rulers for an affordable price.

        Kuru Toga Standard Version
      </a>
      <pre>
        The Kuru Toga Standard Version is a Japanese mechanical pencil with a unique patented system. It has the Kuru Toga Engine which spins the lead while writing and allows the lead to stay sharp without the need for manual spinning of the pencil. 

This pencil is the cheapest with the Kuru Toga Engine, and is entirely plastic apart from the metal tip and the extremely small rubber grip. The grip on the standard Kuru Toga Pencil is uncomfortable to use as the grip is plastic other than the tiny rubber O-ring which only gives grip to the fingertips. For me, when I hold the pencil, none of my fingers can reach the O-ring and only hold the clear plastic grip, which is very slippery. The Kuru Toga Engine, however, works well and keeps the lead sharp. 

I would recommend you not buy this Kuru Toga Pencil and instead buy the newer Kuru Toga KS which I will review below.

        Kuru Toga KS
      </a>
      <pre>
        The Kuru Toga KS is a newer Kuru Toga with a redesigned Kuru Toga Engine. While still being made almost entirely out of plastic, its rubber grip is much bigger and its brand new Kuru Toga Engine massively reduces the wobble that you get on the tip of Kuru Toga Pencils. The pencil is very light and features a rubber grip which provides much more grip compared to the slippery plastic grip on the Standard Kuru Toga. The new Kuru Toga Engine works extremely well and keeps the lead sharp. The tip, however, is quite short compared to drafting pencils

I would recommend you buy this Kuru Toga Pencil if you will benefit from the Kuru Toga Engine.

        Pentel Smash
      </a>
      <pre>
        The Pentel Smash is a popular Japanese Pencil which has a unique half metal half rubber grip. Its grip has small rubber cubes which protrude out of the barrel, providing additional grip for its matte metal grip. The inbuilt eraser is big and the button is satisfying to click. It has a longer tip which is like drafting pencils but don't have the machined look of most drafting pencils. It's barrel is made out of a hard plastic and has a great build quality. Nothing rattles or shakes. 

The Pentel Smash is a great pencil for its great build quality, light weight and unique grip. It is not pocket safe but is a great pencil which feels will last a long time with good care.

      <a>
        Staedtler 925 25
      </a>
      <pre>
        The Staedtler 925 25 is a mostly metal body pencil with a extremely grippy metal grip. Its clip is easily removed and put back and features a eraser with a metal needle stuck in it to fix lead jams. Due to its metal body, it has a nice weight to it and has a fully round body, allowing for easy rotating of the pencil with the clip removed. The tip is long and allows it to be used with rulers easily. Its metal grip is extremely grippy and feels great in my opinion. 

This pencil, due to its metal body, might be slightly more expensive than the rest but has a extremely good build quality and nice grip. It is not pocket safe but feel that it will last a long time with good care.
